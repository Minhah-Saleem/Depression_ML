## Project Overview

**Depression_ML** is a project that applies machine learning and possibly multimodal techniques (text, audio, etc.) to detect or analyze depression from data. The repository includes code for preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and inference.

The goal is to build robust, interpretable models for depression detection.

---

## Motivation & Objectives

- Mental health is an increasingly critical area where automated tools can help screening or early detection.  
- Use data signals (e.g. speech, text, audio features) to predict signs of depression.  
- Explore feature engineering, model architectures, and evaluation strategies.  
- Ensure the results are reliable, explainable, and generalizable.

## Architecture & Pipeline

Here's the typical processing pipeline:

Raw Input Data (text / audio / other)
↓
Preprocessing & Feature Extraction
↓
Train / Validate / Test Split
↓
Model Training (e.g. ML / Deep Learning)
↓
Model Evaluation & Metrics
↓
Inference / Deployment

Modules include:
- Data loader / preprocessing  
- Feature extraction (e.g. MFCCs, text embeddings)  
- Model definitions (e.g. classifiers, neural networks)  
- Training / validation scripts  
- Evaluation scripts & metrics (accuracy, F1, ROC, etc.)  
- Inference / prediction scripts  

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need:
- Python 3.7+  
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `librosa` (if audio), `torch` / `tensorflow` (if deep models), `matplotlib`, `joblib`, etc.  
- (Optional) GPU if you train deep models  
- Dataset(s) (text or audio data with depression labels)  

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Minhah-Saleem/Depression_ML.git
cd Depression_ML

# (Optional) Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Make sure any pretrained model files or checkpoints are placed where your scripts expect them.

## Usage

### Training Models

To train a model, run something like:

```bash
python train_model.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

This does:

* Preprocessing
* Feature extraction
* Model training
* Saving the trained model (e.g. `model.pkl` or a checkpoint)

You may have command-line options for hyperparameters (learning rate, epochs, batch size, etc.).

### Evaluation & Inference

To evaluate the trained model:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model path/to/model --test_data path/to/testset
```

This outputs metrics such as:

* Accuracy
* Precision / Recall / F1
* ROC / AUC
* Confusion matrix

To run inference (predict on new samples):

```bash
python predict.py --model path/to/model --input path/to/new_data
```

---

## Dataset & Preprocessing
* Preprocessing steps:

  * Cleaning (removing noise, normalizing, etc.)
  * Feature extraction (text embeddings, audio features)
  * Splitting into train / validation / test
  * Possibly balancing / augmentation

---

## Limitations & Future Work

* Data imbalance or limited data
* Noise / generalization to unseen domains
* Interpretability / explainability
* Overfitting or model robustness
* Future improvements:

  * More data modalities (e.g. physiological signals)
  * Better models (attention models, transformers)
  * Real-time deployment
  * Cross-domain generalization
